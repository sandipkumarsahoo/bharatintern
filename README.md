Task 1 : Cat and Dog Image Classifier
"Excited to share my latest project! üîç Developed a Cat and Dog Image Classifier using data science techniques in Python.
Leveraging machine learning algorithms like BatchNormalization ,Dropout, the model efficiently distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages.
With thorough data preprocessing and model selection, it achieves high accuracy in classification tasks.
Check out the implementation on my LinkedIn profile for more details! #DataScience
 #MachineLearning
The entire process of setting up a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs. 
It includes downloading and preprocessing the dataset, building and compiling the model, training the model,
visualizing training progress, addressing overfitting, and making predictions on new images.
